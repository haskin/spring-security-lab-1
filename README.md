# Spring Security Lab 1

## Instructions

Update your cryptocurrency application from the `spring-testing` module:

1. Update your "bitcoin" endpoint so that it can take the name of the
   cryptocurrency to get information about in its request.
2. Update all your tests accordingly to ensure that the currency you're getting
   information about is the currency that was requested.
3. Add `httpBasic()` authentication to your new endpoint.
4. Update your tests accordingly.
